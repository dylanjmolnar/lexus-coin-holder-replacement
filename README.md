2007 Lexus GS 450h Coin Holder Replacement Piece

Details:
This piece is meant to replace the coin holder piece in the center console. This should work for any 3rd generation Lexus GS model. It converts the port to a double USB or triple USBC port holder.
The back is powered by tapping into the rear cigarette lighter for high power outlets and optionally with a GROM VLine VL2 product for wired carplay (slower charging).

DC to AC Converter:

I used the GROM VLine VL2 product for part of this build. Located in the glove box, the cables are run behind the infotanement center and under the center console. The provided USB extension cable was used in addition to a UGREEN USB to USBC adapter for wired carplay and charging.

For the other two USBC headers, I tapped into the cigarette charger wire running to the back of the center console. Using the DC to AC converter, I was able to add two high power USBC ports for a total of three ports.
