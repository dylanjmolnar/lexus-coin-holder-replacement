Lexus GS 450h Coin Holder Replacement Piece

Details:
This piece is meant to replace the coin holder piece in the center console. This should work for any 3rd generation Lexus GS model. It converts the port to a double USB or triple USBC port holder.
The back is powered by tapping into the rear cigarette lighter for two high power outlets or in tangent with a GROM VLINE2 product for wired carplay and slower charging.
